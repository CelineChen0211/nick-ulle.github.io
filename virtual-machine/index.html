    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    This slide deck walks through setting up a Linux virtual machine on
    Windows. It takes about 1 hour.
    </p>
    <h3>Get VirtualBox</h3>
    <p>
    We'll use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>
    to run our virtual machine. Go to the VirtualBox
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">downloads page</a>
    and download the Windows installer for VirtualBox, listed under "platform
    packages". Once it's downloaded, run the installer. It's safe to use the
    default installation settings.
    </p>
    <h3>Get Linux</h3>
    <p>
    Next, you need to select the Linux distribution you're going to install.
    There are dozens of different distributions available, and each has certain
    advantages and disadvantages. For the remainder of this tutorial, we'll
    focus on the Xfce edition of <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>,
    because it's user-friendly and has reasonable hardware requirements.
    However, if you're interested in trying a different distribution, go for
    it! Virtual machines are a great, safe way to try out new operating systems
    and software. <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a> lists the
    most popular Linux distributions.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you're following along with Linux Mint,
    <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=182">download</a>
    the disk image. This may take a while.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    First let's configure a new virtual machine in VirtualBox. When you start
    VirtualBox, you should see a dialog like the one below.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-0.jpg" height="400px" />
    <p>
    Click on the "New" button.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Click on "Hide Description" to show the full details of the new virtual
    machine.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-1.jpg" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Enter "Linux" as the name of your virtual machine. VirtualBox will
    automatically guess the correct type and version for you.
    </p>
    <p>
    Set the memory size to the largest power of 2 that's in the green (768 MB 
    is also okay).
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-2.jpg" height="400px" />
    <p>
    Also select "Create virtual hard drive now."
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Choose a location for the virtual hard drive your machine will use,
    and set the disk size to at least 20 GB. You can set a higher disk size,
    but make sure your computer has enough free disk space first.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-3.jpg" />
    <p>
    Also select "Fixed size," which will give slightly better performance.
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Once you finish setting up the virtual machine, you'll be returned to the
    main VirtualBox dialog.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-4.jpg" height="450px" />
    <p>
    Click on the "Settings" button.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    On the Display tab, increase the video memory as much as possible (unless
    you like working at very low resolutions!).
    </p>
    <p>
    Make sure the accelaration boxes are both unchecked, as they can cause
    problems on some computers.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-5.jpg" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    On the Storage tab, click on the disk drive.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-6.jpg" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Use the add disk button to add the Linux Mint ISO to the drive.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-7.jpg" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    After adding the Linux Mint ISO, it should be listed in the dialog.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-8.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
    On the Shared Folders tab, click the add folder button.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-9.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
    Add a folder that's located in a convenient place on your computer. This
    will be important later if you want to transfer files to and from your
    virtual machine.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, make sure auto-mount is on.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-27.jpg" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    You're finally done setting up your virtual machine! All that's left is to
    install Linux.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-11.jpg" height="450px" />
    <p>
    Go ahead and press the "Start" button. You know you want to.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Be patient while the Linux installer boots; it can take several minutes.
    Once it's done, you should see a screen like the one below.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-12.jpg" height="450px" />
    <p>
    Double-click on "Install Linux Mint."
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Work through the installer dialogs. Most of them are self-explanatory, but
    check the following slides for details on a few of them.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-13.jpg" height="450px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Choose "Erase disk and install Linux Mint" at this step.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-14.jpg" height="450px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Choose a sensible username and password. Remember your password, you'll
    need it to install programs on your virtual machine.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-16.jpg" height="450px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    The installation can take up to 30 minutes. After it's done, you'll see the
    prompt below. Click "Continue Testing."
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-17.jpg" height="450px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    In the Linux Mint applications menu, click the log out button, and use the
    prompt that appears to shut down the virtual machine.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-18.jpg" height="450px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    After the machine has shut down, start it back up again. Once it's done
    booting, you should see a screen like the one below.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-20.jpg" height="400px" />
    <p>
    Congratulations, you've successfully installed Linux Mint!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    You might want to use the software manager to install software we'll be
    using in this class.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-21.jpg" height="400px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    In particular, install git...
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-23.jpg" height="400px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    ...and R.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-25.jpg" height="400px" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Rather than shutting down your virtual machine when you're done with it,
    you might want to save it state. This is a bit like putting it to sleep,
    and makes it much faster to start up again later.
    </p>
    <img src="img/image-26.jpg" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
    Good job, you're done!
